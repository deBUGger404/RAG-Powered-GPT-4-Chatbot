# RAG-Powered GPT-4 Chatbot: AI-Based Knowledge Retrieval

🚀 Revolutionizing how we interact with data by leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **GPT-4**. This powerful chatbot allows users to upload documents, create custom knowledge bases, and receive tailored, accurate responses for their specific needs.

## Features
- **Upload Documents**: Upload PDFs or other files, which are automatically chunked into manageable parts and stored in a vector database.
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Create your own knowledge base from the uploaded documents and query it to retrieve the most relevant information.
- **Persistent Databases**: Save and access previously created databases for future use, ensuring data is always at your fingertips.
- **Real-Time Information Retrieval**: Query your knowledge base to get context-aware responses derived directly from your documents.
  
## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? 🔍
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the power of information retrieval with advanced generative models like GPT-4. Instead of only using pre-trained data, this system accesses external datasets (like the files you upload) to provide highly relevant and up-to-date answers.

### Why RAG is Game-Changing:
- **Improved Accuracy**: Get responses that are directly sourced from your data, not generic internet information.
- **Tailored Knowledge**: Create custom knowledge repositories that provide insights specific to your field or research.
- **Efficient Knowledge Management**: Perfect for managing internal documents, policies, user manuals, or research papers.

## Use Cases 📄
- **Research**: Seamlessly navigate large datasets and retrieve specific insights.
- **Business Operations**: Load internal company documents for easy reference and access during decision-making processes.
- **Customer Support**: Build a knowledge-driven chatbot for FAQs, product manuals, or troubleshooting.
- **Training & Onboarding**: Create an internal knowledge base for new employees to interact with, ensuring consistent training.

## How It Works 🤖
1. **Upload and Chunk Files**: 
   - Upload a PDF or document file.
   - The system automatically splits the file into smaller chunks and converts them into vectors.
   - The vectors are stored in a searchable vector database.
   
2. **Create and Query Knowledge Base**:
   - Query the knowledge base by typing your questions.
   - The chatbot retrieves relevant information from your uploaded files using semantic search.
   
3. **Persistent Database Access**:
   - The chatbot saves all databases, enabling continuous use. Access your previous databases anytime through a convenient dropdown menu.
